### Hey there! I am Siri Srinivas. :wave: 

**I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Northeastern University, and a former software engineering co-op at Quickbase.**

My primary experience spans across full-stack development, distributed systems, and cloud computing.  
I am passionate about creating scalable, user-centric solutions, and have professional experience  
working on Java (Spring Boot) with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB on the back end, 
as well as JavaScript (React.js) on the front end.  

Other areas Iâ€™ve explored include machine learning, data science, security, and blockchain development, 
designing interactive web experiences with Greensock, and implementing algorithms in Java and Python.  

I am **actively looking for full-time Software Engineer roles or internships** starting May 2025.  
I have the option to graduate in **Summer 2025** or **December 2025**, depending on opportunities and commitments.
